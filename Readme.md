# OfficeNavigationBar - How to hide a peek form on moving the mouse


<p>This example illustrates how to hide a peek form when the mouse pointer leaves it. The main idea of this approach is to check if the mouse pointer is located within the peek form or <strong>OfficeNavigationBar</strong> boundaries. To simplify the solution, we created a special <strong>OfficeNavigationBarHelper</strong> class. To enable this feature, call the <strong>OfficeNavigationBarHelper.SetPeekFormBehavior</strong> method. </p>
